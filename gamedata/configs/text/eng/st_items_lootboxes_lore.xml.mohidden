I hope those TerraGroup bastards we're chasing down are rotting in some radioactive ditch somewhere, I signed up to shoot looters and capitalists, not deal with this bizarre shit. Let's hope I get the fuck out of here soon. \n \n

		<text>Senior Researcher Pavel,\n \nWe experienced some limited success with the transmutation of the 'Hourglass' artifact. While the application of artifacts in the Fruit Punch anomaly reacted as expected, subsequent addition of the Flash artifact into the field caused an unexpected and drastic surge in energy. Intern Andreychuk was knocked on his back and one of the field computers suffered liquid damage, but thankfully little harm came to our personnel or equipment overall. However, regretfully, our suits and field equipment have been mired in some horrid stench that refuses to go away! We will be requisitioning new equipment and selling our old suits on the black market. I am storing one ingredient for transmutation here; until we fine-tune the recipe I do not want to risk another incident. \n \nStaff Researcher Nikolai \n \n

		<text>Head Professor Sakharov,\n\Yesterday a stalker by the name of Windy visited the Mobile Lab and sold us this very strange artifact. He claims it is the 'essence of a poltergeist'. We are uncertain where the origin of this artifact is - when we pressed the seller for questions, he refused to speak. The composition resembles that of a chunk of quartz, yet is as amorphous as wet sand. Sample floats at rest and exhibits mild gravitational anomalies to small objects nearby, such as rocks. As we lack the proper equipment in our lab, we are sending you this sample for further analysis.\n \nStaff Researcher Nikolai \n \n

Take these lemons to the tunnel in Cordon west of where Kuznetsov's posted: you'll meet some Loners there with a box of artifacts. Bring Lyontsov and Romanenko with you - they can be trusted. Once you're done transacting, leave the artifacts where you found this box.\n \nSgt. Kovalenko\n \n

			\n \nFuck man, I'm dead meat!
			\nThat idiot Marko just had to open his mouth around that bitch Hip in the village! Bragging about how he had the Bizon shotgun and could shoot the balls off a Boar from 100 meters away! Well she heard us and made us a good offer, but that dumb fuck had to mouth off and say that he would only deal with her if she'd sweeten the deal with a blowie! That night we were camping near the train tunnel entrace, that bitch found us with a squad of some really serious looking motherfuckers! She put her handgun on Marko's junk and shot him, took off his fuckin' eggs! She told me to go bring her that shotgun or else she'd shoot my balls off next! Well Artem decided to run away, and my Marko is now sleeping it off in camp while I'm God knows where making sure this shooter is still here. Fuck this shit, I'm getting out of here! I'm going to leave this shotgun where it is and hope she finds it before she finds me! I hope her damn client has this gun blow up in his face.

			\n \n Personal log of Andrei Petrenko
			\n \n Yesterday was my birthday. I have been living in the Zone for almost one year now, give or take the occasional hop to the outside world to fetch supplies. I am starting to enjoy it here - the outside world never afforded me much respect, but here I put in honest work and enjoy the respect of my fellow man. There is something strange about this place, it hates technology and violence. I have cleaned and maintained more guns here just in the last year than in ten years as a gunsmith.

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_sheet1_descr">
		<text>A loose, typed document from military intelligence. The information is encrypted, as is standard procedure for the Military, who transport these documents in the absence of wireless alternatives and decrypt them by hand or with a special device. As such it is not too useful for the layman, though it is rumored that certain organized groups have access to the codes the military uses. The SSU would probably love to get this back, but other groups might get a lot of use out of this.</text>

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_sheet2_descr">
		<text>An old, loose page from a lab notebook. Might be interesting to some parties, but not too useful without the rest of it. The handwriting is messy and smudged, and being kept in less than adequate conditions has not done any favors for its readability. Potentially interesting to scientific groups.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_sheet3_descr">
		<text>A loose document in pretty bad shape. Some diagram is on it, which seems like a complex laboratory device. Liquid stains have rendered most of the typed text indecipherable, but it still may be worth a pittance.</text>

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_sheet4_descr">
		<text>A loose transport invoice detailing what items in what quantity were shipped to what location. Looks new, but you don't know if that's because it was produced recently or happened to be stored in a nice dry environment. Unfortunately the items are only referred to by a code, although the prices next to these items are quite interesting.</text>

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_sheet5_descr">
		<text>Some form of typed communication between two coded parties. No identifying marks of either of the parties are present, aside from two ciphered callsigns.

	<string id="st_lootbox_docs_notebook3_descr">
		<text>This notebook has some accounting information in it, but the entries are encoded for security reasons. This likely belongs to either the military or other independent groups operating in the area, which makes such a document quite dangerous in the wrong hands.</text>
