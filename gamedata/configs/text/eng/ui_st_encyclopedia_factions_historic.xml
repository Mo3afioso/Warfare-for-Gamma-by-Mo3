			%c[guide_blue]Final Day%c[ui_gray] were a faction of scientists, also known as %c[guide_blue]Last Day%c[ui_gray], or as "%c[guide_blue]wild stalkers%c[ui_gray]".\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[ui_gray]\n
			\nThey believed that the Zone would ultimately bring about the end of the world, expanding into and claiming ever more land with each passing emission.\n
			\nAside from their fascination with hunting zombified stalkers for research purposes, and that their now-forgotten leader was assassinated by a stalker called Ghost, little else is known about them.\n
			\nWith their activity occurring shortly after the emission that wiped out much of Clear Sky, it is possible they were a small splinter group - survivors who became unhinged from what they had witnessed.

			The %c[guide_blue]International Scientific Group%c[ui_gray] was founded to research the Zone.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[ui_gray]\n
			\nFollowing the sudden appearance of the Zone, the United Nations created a new research body, with its sole purpose being to research and explain this strange new phenomenon.\n
			\nAn area far in the north surrounding six large generators was seen as the most scientifically interesting, and as such was picked as the site for their expedition.\n
			\nLasting only a few months, their work was plagued by problems they could never have known to prepare for.\n
			\nResearchers would be consumed by unseen anomalies, or ravaged by the horrifically mutated wildlife. Others would inexplicably disappear, only to return days later in a zombified trance trying to kill their colleagues.\n
			\nThe expedition was eventually shut down after accomplishing very little, and resulting in an unacceptably high body count.\n
			\nUndeterred by their failure, an institute was created by the Ukrainian government to carry on their work - now commonly referred to as the Ecologists.

			The %c[guide_blue]Renegades%c[ui_gray] were some of the most feared stakers in the Zone.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[ui_gray]\n
			\nThe Renegades was a title giving to minor Stalker groups made up of some of the most battle-scarred Stalkers who showed hostility to almost everyone as they strive to live a life of lawlessness in the Zone to host their illegal acts.\n
			\nAlthough these groups were usually referred to as a Faction the Renegades were unorganized and mostly independent with them consisting of stalkers living independantly or small groups living in the rough areas of the Zone.\n
			\nWhile these groups were labelled under the banner of "Renegades" by most, these stalkers didn't care about having a Faction identity, as they tried to live in the Zone free of negative influences from other Factions.
