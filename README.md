# Warfare for Gamma by Mo3
 not supported by the gamma team, but is a full warfare overhaul for gamma. 
inlcudes a modified ZcP
      LOTS of zone changes, ai pathing, hardcore mutant spawns, hardcore ai combat enhancements.. and much more. 


This is based off of Vintar's warfare overhaul, the most recent build (always) 
ZcP is built off of 1.5e, but the OG 1.5e WILL NOT WORK. YOU ONLY NEED WHAT I INCLUDED!
