This merges Warfare-alife overhaul and ZcP to be fully gamma compatible. 

In this version, there's optimization updates, new zoning for mutants thanks to MonsterWorld mod. its not included and does not work, but i looked at some of their scripts and spawns and used a few for warfare. be careful.  

Just untick "Limited fast travel rebalance" and "ZcP 1.4 balanced spawns"  

YOU DO NOT NEED THE GAMMA WARFARE PATCH!! or any other warfare patch for that matter (at this time)

just load this highest and use the new functions added by Vintar to control warfare spawns, and ZcP to fine tune them. 

special loadouts included, load it above this. 

Curse of immortality for gamma included. I will redux it later to fit better, but for now, it adds a really awesome dynamic. Makes hording important. 

This MIGHT work on EFP and base anomaly, but i will not be providing support and neither will maid. 

Grok does not support Warfare. I do. So dont bother him with issues when you load this. 
go to my chat and one of us or myself will help. 

No extra mods have been tested at this time, just base gamma. 

Untick Cordon early game tweaks
tick xenotech protect cordon base if you go loner.
