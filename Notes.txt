This merges Warfare-alife overhaul and ZcP to be fully gamma compatible. 

In this version, there's optimization updates, new zoning for mutants thanks to MonsterWorld mod. its not included and does not work, but i looked at some of their scripts and spawns and used a few for warfare. be careful.  

Just untick ALL THE FAST TRAVEL MODS INCLUDED IN GAMMA!!!




YOU DO NOT NEED THE GAMMA WARFARE PATCH!! or any other warfare patch for that matter (at this time)




just load this highest and use the new functions added by Vintar to control warfare spawns, and ZcP to fine tune them. 



special loadouts NO LONGER INCLUDED, USE WARDOGS FOR FULL EXPERIENCE!


Curse of immortality for gamma included. AKA TARKOV MODE. mcm config 



This MIGHT work on EFP and base anomaly, but i will not be providing support and neither will maid. 

Grok does not support Warfare. I do. So dont bother him with issues when you load this. 
go to my chat and one of us or myself will help. 



No extra mods have been tested at this time, just base gamma. 


Untick Cordon early game tweaks
untick no exo in south 
           This is ONLY if you want more of an OG stalker southern zone. it is harder, but mutants in the south will keep populations managed.


You no longer need skills 2.0

this no longer has lootboxes or hobo matches built in. 

for the full effect of the overhaul, load this in with WarDogs. 

this should be higher prio. check the modlist in the wardogs downloads.
